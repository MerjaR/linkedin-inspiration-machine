# LinkedIn Content Prompt Generator 🧠✍️

A zero-API MVP built for free in under 1 hour with Replit and ChatGPT.

This app helps you craft prompts to use in ChatGPT (or Claude) to generate more interesting and engaging LinkedIn posts. It was created for the purpose of testing no-coding skills required tools for a blog post. For full transparency, ChatGPT was used to generate a fair bit of code and Replit crashed during making changes to the code. Why is it not deployed on Replit? Requires payment card even for free plan. This is just a demo.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Collects a few inputs: your topic, tone/persona (e.g. Elon Musk, Seth Godin), role, company name, style preferences, and key facts.
- Generates **5 example content ideas** (hardcoded sets rotate if you click “Generate Again”).
- Lets you choose 1 idea + 1 enhancement style (e.g. storytelling, stats, a quote).
- Assembles a **ChatGPT-ready prompt** using your selections and inputs.
- **Currently no tokens or API calls used** — I wanted a demo without incurring LLM costs.

> ⚠️ Note: This MVP does not connect to any AI service. The content ideas are hardcoded to avoid incurring token costs, but the structure is ready to plug into OpenAI or Claude if you fork it.

## 🧪 Sample Output (from a real prompt)

👇 This is the kind of result you could get from ChatGPT by pasting in the prompt generated by this app.

**Prompt generated by the app:**

> Take idea #1 ("Compare your company's growth to a well-known startup and extract lessons.")  
> Write it as a full LinkedIn post.  
> Use a tone and voice similar to **Bill Gates**.  
> This is for a **software engineer at Flowdash**.  
> Make it a **listicle style post**.  
> Include this context: **we just hit 10k users**  
> Include a **quote from an industry leader**

**ChatGPT-style output:**

> **5 Lessons from Growing to 10K Users at Flowdash (and What Stripe Taught Us)**
>
> As a software engineer at **Flowdash**, I’ve been reflecting on our path to **10,000 users**. It wasn’t magic — but it also wasn’t luck. It was methodical learning from companies that’ve done this before.
>
> One of those companies is **Stripe**, and here’s what we took from their playbook:
>
> 1. **Developers are your early adopters**  
> Stripe won because developers loved them. We leaned into that too: building clean APIs, minimal UIs, and shipping things that worked.
>
> 2. **Infrastructure matters more than hype**  
> The best growth spike is the one that doesn’t crash your product. We invested in backend robustness early, and it paid off when traffic spiked.
>
> 3. **Thoughtful defaults scale faster**  
> Patrick Collison once said:  
> > “The best products are the ones that require the least explanation.”  
> That became a north star for us — fewer settings, more sense.
>
> 4. **Consistency builds trust**  
> Stripe’s design is a case study in consistency. At Flowdash, we adopted a “no dead ends” design rule — every interaction moves the user forward.
>
> 5. **Your product is a means, not the end**  
> Nobody cares about your tool — they care about the result. That mindset shifted how we talked to users, wrote copy, and prioritized features.
>
> We're not Stripe, but we’re learning from the best — and hopefully building something worthy of imitation too.

## 🧩 Want to Add AI?

You can! The content ideas are hardcoded in this version for demo purposes (to avoid paying per user prompt), but it’s ready to plug into any LLM.

Just replace the idea-generating logic with an API call like this:

```js
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: yourPrompt }]
  })
});
